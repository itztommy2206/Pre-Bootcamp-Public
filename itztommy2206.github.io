        <p class="dogs">My first day of coding started when I first moved into my first home. Hopeless and didnt really understanding anything about coding, I started to try and picm up python as my first language. I then become intrigue with coding at that point and wanted to learn more about the process, therefore, I looked to my friend who referred my to learing the front-end of every developement which was HTML, CSS and Javascript. I began my journey here on khan academy learning all about the different aspects of tags in htlm and some styling choices in css. I am still very much a beginner but I hope to improve and be a good self sufficient developer in a few years into this field. From there on I will become the hokage of the village.</p>

        <p class="dogs">On this day will be my first day of the week of me ultimately starting my frist class online with coding dojo. I am very excited to learn everything that they can teach me and take on every project that I can get to ultimately build my profolio and become self sufficient developer. I have been learning on the side with khan academy and youtube at the moment to strenghten my knowledge about coding before starting at coding dojo. Hopefully with this knowledge, I won't be a total beginner.</p>

        <p class="dogs">The day I finally graduate from the coding dojo with a profolio ready in hand and me going out to the field of developemnt hoping to find connections. I first want to do some free or maybe small projects for some clients just to get my name out there and develope my profolio even further than what I already can accomplish at coding dojo. I then want to first find a part time gig if I cannot remain at Invitae Corperation but ultimately the best case scenario would be me applying directly into their Software Development team and department and assist with the evergrowing company that Invitae might become. I then hope to finally move on into a tech company and work as a full-time developer.</p>
